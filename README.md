# A Meme Generator project 

This is a react project built with bootstrap, and api. This project is a part of
Scrimba's section 3 react basis course.

In this project, I have learned many things including:
- Event Listener
- State
- Conditional rendering
- Forms
- useEffect hook
- Promises: async and await
